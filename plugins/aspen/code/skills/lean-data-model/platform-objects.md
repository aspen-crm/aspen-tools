# The platform objects, and what people call them

Question 1 of `lean-data-model` is "which platform object already holds this". This is the
catalogue to check it against. Read it before authoring a new object, every time — the business
word and the platform word are usually different, which is exactly why the check gets skipped.

**The list below is from a real instance at platform 26.3.3 and is a convenience, not the
authority.** The authority is `ls metacode/platform/object_p/` in the folder you are in, because
an installed application package adds `_a` objects this cannot know about.

## The words that catch people out

## Before adding a field to one

A platform object can be **extended** with `_c` fields, which is almost always the right move and
needs no new component. What it cannot be is **overridden**: a base object type, a platform
picklist and the stock `tab_collection_p:aspen_crm_p` all reject an override, by import and by the
offline validator alike. `using-aspen` has the details and the workarounds.

Two traps worth knowing before you extend one:

- **A field's `description` carries behaviour the type does not.** `contact_p.name_p` is
  `required: true` and derived from the name parts; writing it fails on every record. Read the
  description in the compiled tier, not just `type` and `required`.
- **Some child rows are created for you.** Setting `contact_p.primary_account_p` makes a
  `contact_role_p`; setting `opportunity_p.owner_p` makes an `employee_role_p`. Before modelling a
  join object, create one parent and look at what appeared underneath it.
