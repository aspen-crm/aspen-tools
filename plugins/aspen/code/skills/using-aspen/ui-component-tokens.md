# Aspen components and their token families (`--ap-comp-*`)

Companion to `ui-design-tokens.md`, which carries the rules. This file helps you **choose** the
component whose tokens to use. It does not list token names.

## Where the names are

The installed SDK has one typed module per component, generated from its token snapshot:

```sh
ls  metacode/ui/ui_main_c/node_modules/@aspen-crm/sdk/dist/tokens/comp/            # one file per family
cat metacode/ui/ui_main_c/node_modules/@aspen-crm/sdk/dist/tokens/comp/select.d.ts
```

Each export's JSDoc gives its custom property (`--ap-comp-select-…`) and its value under each
theme and breakpoint, so you can see which semantic token it aliases. The same file is what
`import * as select from '@aspen-crm/sdk/tokens/comp/select'` resolves to. Read only the families
you picked; never guess a name.

Pattern: `--ap-comp-<family>-<part>[-<variant>][-<state>]`. The family is the file name. Some
components are split across several families: a part family (`cardheader`, `menubase`) belongs
with its parent and is styled together with it.

## Choosing a family

Choose by what the control **does**, not what it looks like. A field's meaning decides its control
(see the table in `ui-design-tokens.md`); this table names the token families for that control.

### Form controls

| Family                             | Use for                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `textinput`                        | Single-line text field: label, input, helper and error text.                                                |
| `textarea`                         | Multi-line text.                                                                                            |
| `numberinput`                      | Numeric and currency values. Keeps numeric input semantics; do not reuse `textinput` or `select` styles.    |
| `passwordinput`                    | Masked secret entry.                                                                                        |
| `phoneinput`                       | Phone number.                                                                                               |

| `multiselect`                      | Several choices from a fixed list.                                                                          |
| `typeahead`                        | Pick **one record** by searching: a lookup. Not `select`, even for a short list of records.                 |
| `typeaheadmulti`                   | Pick several records by searching; selections show as chips.                                                |
| `contacttypeahead`                 | Pick contacts as recipients, shown as `contactpill`s while typing.                                          |
| `checkbox`, `checkboxgroup`        | Independent yes/no options; the group lays out several with a label.                                        |
| `radio`, `radiobase`, `radiogroup` | One choice from a few options all visible at once. `radiobase` is the ring and dot.                         |
| `switch`                           | An on/off setting that applies immediately. Use a checkbox for a form value submitted later.                |
| `search`                           | Free-text search box filtering a list or page. Not a record lookup.                                         |
| `dateinput`                        | Typed date field.                                                                                           |
| `datepicker`                       | Date field with a calendar popover: `datemenu` is the popover, `calendar` the month grid, `datecell` a day. |

| `datetimepicker`                   | Date plus time in one field.                                                                                |
| `timepicker`                       | Time of day.                                                                                                |
| `fileupload`                       | Drop zone and picker for attaching files.                                                                   |
| `document`                         | One attached file: name, size, remove icon.                                                                 |

Nothing here fits? Compose from `--ap-sem-*`. Something fits but you are deliberately not
building it? See the exemption in `ui-design-tokens.md`'s "Rebuilding an Aspen component?" rule.
